# Changelog
## KNOWN ISSUES
- Install slower to add chrome, 1-5 minutes. I can't fix that.
## v1.3.2.3 - August 2026

- **Chromium Support:** Added dynamic architecture detection to install and run Chromium with GPU hardware acceleration on x86_64 hosts, vastly improving rendering of heavy dashboards and WebRTC streams.
- **Browser Toggle:** Added UI configuration option to seamlessly switch between Chromium and Luakit engines.
- **Browser Mod Integration:** Added real-time log parsing to intercept and broadcast the `browser_mod` ID natively in the Add-on UI logs.
### Fixed
- **Touchscreen Rotation:** Corrected the X11 `TransformationMatrix` coordinates for standard left/right display rotation.
- **Process Monitoring:** Fixed a bug where the `run.sh` script would incorrectly time out and kill the Chromium browser process.
- **Log Spam:** Silenced AT-SPI accessibility warnings and DBus errors when running Chromium inside the Alpine Docker container.

  locking down (and unlocking) inputs by disabling keyboard, mouse and
  touch functions

  REST_API to change audio state (`toggle_audio` can also be used in
  gesture action commands)
- Converted default gestures in `config.yaml` to use internal
  `kiosk.<function>` handlers rather than calling shell functions

  enable/disable inputs, mute/unmute audio, and rotate through a list of
  URLs

## v1.2.0 - January 2026

- Added ability to set HA theme in config.yaml
- Added USB audio (`audio: true` and `usb: true` in config.yaml) Added
  corresponding config option `audio_sink` which can be: auto, hdmi, usb,
  or none.
- Increased ulimit (in config.yaml) to reduce crashes from heavy usage
- Improved browser refresh logic and stability by:
  - Changing browser refresh from JS injection to native luakit view:reload
  - Forcing hard reload (including cache) every HARD_RELOAD_FREQ reloads
    (refreshes)
  - Killing and restarting luakit if ang page fails to reload more than
    MAX_LOAD_FAILURES in a row
- Improved logging of browser refresh
- Added luakit memory process logging after every page load
- Added JS injections to protect against browser errors & crashes
- Improved robustness and debug output for associating udevadm paths with
  libinput list devices
- Changed run.sh exit logic so that quits if no luakit process for at least
  10 seconds (even if original luakit process has exited)
- Removed config.yaml parameter `allow_user_command` and replaced with
  `command_whitelist` regex. Also added internal whitelist, blacklist, and
  dangerous shell tokens list along with path restrictions (see README.md)
  for details on how behavior has changed.
- Wrote complete Python 'xinput2' parser to detect broad range of mouse and
  touch gestures and execute gesture-specific commands. Replaces prior very
  limited tkinter implementation. See 'mouse_touch_inputs.py' and
  'gesture_commmands.json'
- Added corresponding 'gestures' list option to config.yaml
- Added 'Option "GrabDevice" "true"' to keyboard InputClass section in
  xorg.conf
- Added mouse buttons (left/right/middle/drag) to default Onboard keyboard
  layout
- Refactored and rewrote `rest_server.py`
- Added `REST_IP` to options to allow users to set the listening IP address
